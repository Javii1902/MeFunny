<!--In Angular, we have to access to what we refer to as "directives". These allows us to invoke Angular functionality without breaking our frontend. Even Angular components are considered directives. We use directives to perform simple structural manipulation or make simple changes to attribute values.

  Some of the most common Angular directives are referred to as "structural directives". Structural directives actually change the structure of the web page (e.g. they add elements/remove elements).

  Let's start with *ngFor. ngFor allows us to render an element multiple times.
  NOTE: Structural directives are preceded by an *. 

  We can also use *ngIf. This works like an "if" statement in that *ngIf only renders an element if it is "true".

<button (click)="showContainer()">Show Container</button>
<div *ngIf="containerIsVisible" id="recipe_container">
  <!--In order to pass state down to our child component, we use this property binding syntax. The property called "card" exists on the child component because we we created it. Now we just assign to the value of the loop variable.
  
  Note also that we are passing state from the child to the parent component using an event emitter. The $event syntax allows us to pass the emitted value to a function that exists on our HomeComponent.-->
  <app-meme (updateMemeEvent)="receiveMemeFromChild($event)" *ngFor="let m of memes" [meme]="m"></app-meme>

  <!--Dynamic Card Used For Showcasing Binding-->
  <!-- Commented out as it was only here to prove that our ngModel was working.-->
  <!--
  <div [hidden]="isVisible" class="recipe_div">
    <h3>{{card.name}}</h3>
    <p>{{card.description}}</p>
    The "src" here is an element attribute. We use element attributes to specify some additional information about the element. Other common attributes include "class", "id", "name", "label".
    <img src="{{card.img_url}}" />
    <ol>
        <li>{{card.step}}</li>
    </ol>
